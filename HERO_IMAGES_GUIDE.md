## Tips for Choosing Images

### Composition
- Leave 40-50% of left side clear for text overlay
- Avoid busy patterns or text in the left portion
- Center of interest should be right of center

### Color Palette
- Natural, realistic colors work best
- Slightly desaturated images look more professional
- Avoid overly bright or neon colors
- Grayscale filter is applied, so contrast is important

### Consistency
- Try to maintain similar lighting across all 6 images
- Keep composition style consistent (all close-ups OR all lifestyle shots)
- Similar color temperature across slides

### Testing
- Preview images at full screen to check quality
- Ensure text is readable over the image
- Check how gradient overlay affects visibility
